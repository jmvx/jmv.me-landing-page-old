			<h2 class="entrytitle"><a name="1">Algebraic Expressions</a></h2>
		
			<p>The last time I taught Algebraic Expressions, I taught it in the context of
				the Border Problem. The Border Problem starts as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>Part 1: You have a 10-foot by 10-foot garden. You want to put a tiled path
				around the garden. Without counting every tile, how many tiles do you need to
				make the path?</blockquote>
			<p>Students are then asked to share their methods for counting the tiles. Some students
				might say that they counted 10 tiles on each of the four sides of the garden, plus 4
				extra tiles on the corners. If the dimension of their garden is: \(N \times N\) Then students could
				rewrite their method as an algebraic expression: \[4N + 4\]</p>
			<p>Students can then make posters that show how many tiles a garden of \(N\) dimension needs. They would
				be asked to pay attention to labeling their poster, color coding, and using units when necessary.
				They would also be required to define what the variable \(N\) represents.</p>
			<p>Note that in order to do this lesson, a discussion of what a variable is might be required. The teacher
				could also introduce the concept of the variable after a few students have shared their methods for
				counting. If students produce slightly different variations such as \(4N + 4\) vs. \(4(N + 1)\),
				this could prompt a discussion about properties of rational numbers such as the distributive property.

			<h2 class="entrytitle"><a name="2">Integer Addition and Subtraction</a></h2>
		
			<h3>Number Line</h3>
			<p>The common way that integer addition is taught is with the number line. A positive integer
				means you move in the positive direction on the number line. A negative integer
				means you move in the negative direction on the number line. But how does subtraction work?</p>
			<p>I was really unsatisfied with the traditional number line approach, specifically because
				of its limitations with subtraction. I wanted a simple, easy to understand algorithm that
				explained addition <emph>and</emph> subtraction. Why limit each model to just one or the other?</p>
			<p>A colleague of mine in the Stanford Teacher Education Program suggested a method. Subtraction is
				the opposite of addition. When you subtract, the "positive direction" becomes switched. Think
				about a fish swimming up and down the number line.</p>
				<blockquote>If "right" is initially considered the positive direction and "left" is considered
					the negative direction, then \(5 - 7 = ?\) can be solved by swimming to the right 5 spaces.
					Since you are performing subtraction, turn the fish around so it's now facing the left. Traveling
					to the left used to be a negative operation, but now it's positive. Since we are subtracting
					positive 7, swim forward 7 spaces. This would result in the fish at -2 on the number 
					line.</blockquote>
			<p>However, this method just seemed too hard. It was confusing and overcomplicated things. In the future
				I would probably not use this method for subtraction and instead, focus on drawing my students'
				attention to the similarities between simple subtraction problems and adding negative numbers.
				Then, they can make the generalization that they can use the number line strategy for both addition
				and subtraction by converting all subtraction problems to addition.</p>
			
			<h3>Algebra Chips</h3>
			<p>If you have at least two colors of algebra chips, you can have one color represent negative numbers and
				the other color represent positive numbers. This method is useful for integer addition since students
				can combine positive and negative numbers to "cancel out" to zero and leave them with the answer. For
				example.</p>
				
			<p>If \(x\) represents a negative number and \(o\) represents a positive number, then \(5 + (-3)\) is modeled
				by 	\[o o o o o\]
					\[x x x\]
					
				the three \(x\)'s will combine with three \(o\)'s to create 
				\(0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\). </p>
				
			<p>Algebra chips are not the most effective for modeling subtraction. If subtraction is modeled as
				"taking away" then how do you model 5 - 7? You can have the students add "zeros" to increase the number
				of positive chips to subtract, but this can get somewhat confusing when students are learning this 
				method in conjunction with addition. I suggest sticking with the number line. Positive numbers move
				to the right, negative numbers move to the left. Rewrite subtraction problems as an addition problem.</p>
				
			<p>In order to convince students that rewriting subtraction problems as addition problems work, you can
				have the students do simple problems such as 5 - 3, 7 - 2, 3 - 1 by traditional means. Then, ask them
				to do the problems 5 + (-3), 7 + (-2), and 3 + (-1) using their number line. They should result in the
				same answers.</p>
			
			<h3>Thermometer</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.raftbayarea.org/readpdf?isid=622">Here</a> is a resource from RAFT that demonstrates a game that can be used to teach adding positive and 
				negative numbers. </p>
